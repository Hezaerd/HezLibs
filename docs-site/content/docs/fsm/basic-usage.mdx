## Basic Usage

For simplicity, we will use <span className="underline font-bold">Unity</span>
to demonstrate the basic usage of the StateMachine.

This section demonstrates how to create and use a simple state machine.

We will create a simple state machine for a player character.

<Steps>

    <Step>
        ## Create Your Custom State

        Create a custom abstract class that implements `IState`.
        We will use Dependency Injection to inject the player into states.

        ```csharp title="PlayerState.cs"
        using hezaerd.fsm;

        public abstract class PlayerState : IState
        {
            protected Player Player;

            public BasePlayerState(Player player) { Player = player; }

            public virtual void OnEnter() { }
            public virtual void OnExit() { }
            public virtual void OnUpdate() { }
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Define Your States

        Now you can create your states by inheriting from your `PlayerState` class.

        ```csharp title="IdleState.cs"
        using UnityEngine;

        public class IdleState : PlayerState
        {
            public IdleState(Player player) : base(player) { }

            public override void OnEnter() => Debug.Log("Enter Idle");
            public override void OnExit() => Debug.Log("Exit Idle");
            public override void OnUpdate() => Debug.Log("Idling");
        }
        ```

        ```csharp title="WalkState.cs"
        using UnityEngine;

        public class WalkState : PlayerState
        {
            public WalkState(Player player) : base(player) { }

            public override void OnEnter() => Debug.Log("Enter Walk");
            public override void OnExit() => Debug.Log("Exit Walk");
            public override void OnUpdate() => Debug.Log("Walking");
        }
        ```

        _It is recommended to create a folder for your states and put all your states in there._

        <Files>
            <Folder name="Player" defaultOpen>
                <Folder name="States" defaultOpen>
                    <File name="PlayerState.cs" />
                    <File name="IdleState.cs" />
                    <File name="WalkState.cs" />
                </Folder>
                <File name="Player.cs" />
            </Folder>
        </Files>

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Create Your State Machine

        Now you can add your state machine to your player class.

        ```csharp title="Player.cs"
        public class Player : MonoBehaviour
        {
            private StateMachine _fsm;

            private void Awake()
            {
                _fsm = new StateMachine();
            }

            // VERRY IMPORTANT!: allow to transition between states
            private void Update()
            {
                _fsm.Update();
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Register Your States

        Now you can register your states to the state machine.

        ```csharp title="Player.cs"
        private void Awake()
        {
            _fsm = new StateMachine();

            // Create and register your states
            var idleState = _fsm.CreateState<IdleState>(this); // <- Inject the player instance
            var walkState = _fsm.CreateState<WalkState>(this);

            _fsm.SetRoot(idleState);
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Create Your Predicates

        To determine when transitions should happen, we need `IPredicate` instances. The library provides a convenient helper called `FuncPredicate` for this purpose.

        Let's create predicates for transitioning between `Idle` and `Walk` states based on the `W` key:

        ```csharp title="Player.cs"
        using UnityEngine;
        using hezaerd.fsm;

        public class Player : MonoBehaviour
        {
            private FuncPredicate IdlePredicate => new FuncPredicate(() => Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.W));
            private FuncPredicate WalkPredicate => new FuncPredicate(() => Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.W));
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Add Transitions to Your State Machine

        Now that we have our predicates, we can use them to define the transitions between states:

        ```csharp title="Player.cs"
        private void Awake()
        {
            /* Existing code... */

            // Add transitions between states using the predicates
            _fsm.AddTransition(idleState, walkState, WalkPredicate);
            _fsm.AddTransition(walkState, idleState, IdlePredicate);

            _fsm.SetRoot(idleState);
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've learned how to set up and use a basic state machine for your player character.
This fondation allows you to manager compelxe behaviour in a clean and maintainable way.

- Try adding more states and transitions to handle additional actions.
- Explore advanced features such as `AnyTransition` or custom `IStateFactory`.
- Check out the [Advanced Usage](/docs/fsm/advanced-usage) guide for more powerful patterns.
- Refer to the [API Reference](/docs/fsm/api-reference) for more detailed documentation.
