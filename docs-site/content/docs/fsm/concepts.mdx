## IState\<TOwner>

A **state** is a class implementing `IState<TOwner>`.
It defines:

- `OnEnter(TOwner owner)`: Called when entering the state.
- `OnExit(TOwner owner)`: Called when leaving the state.
- `OnUpdate(TOwner owner)`: Called every update/tick.
- `OnFixedUpdate(TOwner owner)`: Called every fixed update (optional).

## IPredicate

A **predicate** is a condition object implementing `IPredicate` with a single method:

- `bool Evaluate()`: Returns true if the transition should occur.

## ITransition\<TOwner>

A **transition** links a source state to a target state, with a condition:

- `IState<TOwner> TargetState`
- `IPredicate Condition`

## StateMachine\<TOwner>

The **StateMachine** is the core class.
- Generic over an `owner` type (e.g., your player, AI, etc).
- Manages state registration, transitions, "any" transitions, history, and state changes.
- Not tied to Unity or MonoBehaviour.
